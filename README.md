multilib
========

This work mainly presents multiplications over galois field with various w, and it is now under development.

I focus on this work due to the fact that our lab team is studying the storage coding without our own much-basic multiplications lib, so I start to figure this work out and I want some impovements based on the formers' work.

My plan is organised as followed:

1. multiply by 2;

2. multiplication table and log;

3. when w is much bigger, then what can we do to fulfill such work and improve the performence;

4. taking hardware into consideration, eg. SIMD, where can we deploy our multiplication more brilliant;

5. finally, after all stated above being realised, whether we can have some ingenious ideas on the matrix presented along multiplications, eg. dividing the matrix, and then we can have some revolutions in the end.
